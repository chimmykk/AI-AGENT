    "I went outside today for a walk and ended up on a random street I've never seen before. Thatâ€™s the best part about living in Japanâ€”adventure is literally around every corner.",

    "Gotta hit up the fish market later todayâ€”if I catch a glimpse of Nemo, itâ€™ll be the highlight of my day. Who knew a fictional fish could be so iconic.",
